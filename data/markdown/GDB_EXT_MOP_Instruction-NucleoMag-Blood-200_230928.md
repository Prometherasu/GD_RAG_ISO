Genomic DNA from blood
#### **2 Product description**

**2.1** **The basic principle**

The **NucleoMag** **[®]** **Blood 200 μL** procedure is based on reversible adsorption of nucleic
acids to paramagnetic beads under appropriate buffer conditions. Whole blood is
lysed with Lysis Buffer MBL1 and Proteinase K. Following lysis incubation, magnetic
beads are added and binding conditions under which the DNA binds to the magnetic
beads are adjusted by addition of Binding Buffer MBL2. After magnetic separation and
removal of the supernatant, the paramagnetic beads are washed three times to remove
contaminants and salt. There is no need for a drying step as ethanol from previous
wash steps is removed by Wash Buffer MBL4. Finally, highly purified DNA is eluted with
low-salt Elution Buffer MBL5 and can directly be used for downstream applications. The
**NucleoMag** **[®]** **Blood 200 μL** kit can be used either manually or automated on standard
liquid handling instruments or automated magnetic separators.

**2.2** **Kit specifications**

**NucleoMag** **[®]** **Blood 200 μL** is designed for rapid manual and automated smallscale preparation of highly pure genomic DNA from 200 μL whole blood using the
NucleoMag [®] 96 SEP (see ordering information) or other magnetic separation systems
(see section 2.3). Manual time for the preparation of 96 samples is about 120 minutes.
The obtained DNA can be used directly as template for PCR, blotting, or any kind of
enzymatic reactions.

**NucleoMag** **[®]** **Blood 200 μL** allows easy automation on common liquid handling
instruments or automated magnetic separators, for example Thermo Scientific’s
KingFisher [®] instruments. The actual processing time depends on the configuration of
your instrument and the magnetic separation system used. Typically, 96 samples can
be purified in less than 120 minutes using the NucleoMag [®] SEP on the automation
platform.

The kit provides reagents for the purification of 2–8 μg of pure genomic DNA from
200 μL whole blood with an A 260 / A 280 ratio ≥ 1.6–1.9 and typical concentration of
20–40 ng/μL. Depending on the health status of the blood donor and the elution volume
used, concentrations of 10–160 ng/μL can be obtained.

Fresh or frozen blood treated either with EDTA or citrate can be used. The procedure is
optimized for a sample volume of 200 μL.

**NucleoMag** **[®]** **Blood 200 μL** can be processed completely at room temperature,
however, elution at 55 °C or 72 °C will increase the yield by about 15–20 %.

**NucleoMag** **[®]** **Blood Beads** are highly reactive, superparamagnetic beads. The
binding capacity is approximately 0.4 μg of gDNA per 1 μL of NucleoMag [®] Blood Bead
Suspension, 1 μL of suspension contains 140 μg of beads.

Genomic DNA from blood

**2.3** **Magnetic separation systems**

For use of **NucleoMag** **[®]** **Blood 200 μL,** the use of the magnetic separator NucleoMag [®]
SEP is recommended. Separation is carried out in a Square-well Block (see ordering
information). The kit can also be used with other common separators.

**Magnetic separator** **Separation plate or tube**

|NucleoMag® SEP (MN REF 744900)|Square-well Block (MN REF 740481)|
|---|---|
|Tecan Te-MagS™|1.5 mL tubes without lid (Sarstedt)|



**Static magnetic pins**

Separators with static magnetic pins, for example, NucleoMag [®] SEP (for manual use
and for use on liquid handling workstations): This type of separator is recommended in
combination with a suitable microplate shaker for optimal resuspension of the beads
during the washing and elution steps. Alternatively, beads can be resuspended in the
buffer by pipetting up and down several times. For fully-automated use on liquid handling
workstations, a gripper tool is required, the plate is transferred to the magnetic separator
for separation of the beads and transferred to the shaker module for resuspension of
the beads.

**Movable magnetic systems**

Separators with moving magnetic pins, for example Te-MagS™ (for automated use
only): Magnetic pins / rods are moved from one side of the well to the other and vice
versa. Beads follow this movement and are thus pulled through the buffer during the
wash and elution steps. Separation takes place when the system stops the movement.

**Automated separators (e.g., King Fisher** **[®]** **instruments)**

Separators with moving magnets: Magnetic beads are transferred into suitable plates
or tubes. Beads are resuspended from the rod-covered magnets. Following binding,
washing or elution beads are collected again with the rod-covered magnets and
transferred to the next plate or tube.*

**2.4** **Adjusting the shaker settings**

When using a plate shaker for the washing and elution steps, the speed settings have
to be adjusted carefully for each specific separation plate and shaker to prevent crosscontamination from well to well. Proceed as follows:

**Adjusting shaker speed for wash steps:**

   - Load 800 μL dyed water to the wells of the separation plate. Place the plate on
the shaker and start shaking with a moderate speed setting for 30 seconds. Turn
off the shaker and check plate surface for small droplets of dyed water.

   - Increase speed setting, shake for an additional 30 seconds, and check plate
surface for droplets again.

   - Continue increasing the speed setting until you observe droplets on top of the
separation plate. Reduce speed setting, check again and use this setting for the
washing step.

**Adjusting shaker speed for the elution step:**

   - Load 100 μL dyed water to the wells of the collection plate and proceed as
described above.

**2.5** **Handling of beads**

**Distribution of beads**

A homogeneous distribution of the magnetic beads to the individual wells of the
separation plate is essential for a high well-to-well consistency. Therefore, before
distributing the beads, make sure that the beads are completely resuspended. Shake
the storage bottle well or place it on a vortexer shortly. Premixing magnetic beads
with the Binding Buffer MBL2 allows easier homogenous distribution of the beads to
the individual wells of the separation plate. During automation, a premix step before
aspirating the beads / binding buffer mixture from the reservoir is recommended to keep
the beads resuspended.

**Magnetic separation time**

Attraction of the magnetic beads to the magnetic pins depends on the magnetic strength
of the magnetic pins, the selected separation plate, the distance of the separation
plate from the magnetic pins, and the volume to be processed. The individual times for
complete attraction of the beads to the magnetic pins should be checked and adjusted
on each system. It is recommended to use the separation plates or tubes specified by
the supplier of the magnetic separator.

Genomic DNA from blood

**Washing the beads**

Washing the beads can be achieved by shaking or mixing. In contrast to mixing by
pipetting up and down mixing by shaker or magnetic mixing allows simultaneous mixing
of all samples. This reduces the time and number of tips needed for the preparation.
Resuspension by pipetting up and down, however, is more efficient than mixing by
a shaker or magnetic mix. Complete and homogenous resuspension of the beads in
wash buffers MBL3, MBL4, and 80 % ethanol is mandatory for best performance of the
kit.



|Magnetic mix|+|++|Low|
|---|---|---|---|
|Shaker|++|++|Low|
|Pipetting|+++|+*|High|


+: acceptable, ++: good, +++: excellent

**2.6** **Elution procedures**


Purified total DNA can be eluted directly with the supplied Elution Buffer MBL5. Elution
can be carried out in a volume of ≥ 50 μL. It is essential to cover the NucleoMag [®]
B-Beads completely with Elution Buffer MBL5 during the elution step. The volume of
dispensed Elution Buffer MBL5 depends on the magnetic separation system (e.g., the
position of the pellet inside the separation plate). For efficient elution, the magnetic
bead pellet should be resuspended completely in the Elution Buffer MBL5. For some
separators high elution volumes might be necessary to cover the whole magnetic bead
pellet.

Elution is possible at room temperature. However, DNA yield can be increased by 15–
20 % if elution is performed at 72 °C (see Figure 2).

#### **4 Safety instructions**

When working with the **NucleoMag** **[®]** **Blood 200 µL** kit wear suitable protective clothing
(e.g., lab coat, disposable gloves, and protective goggles).

For more information consult the appropriate Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS
available online at _**www.mn-net.com/msds**_ ).

Caution: Guanidin hydrochloride in Buffer MBL1, sodium perchlorate in buffer MBL2
and MBL3 can form highly reactive compounds when combined with bleach! Thus, do
not add bleach or acidic solutions directly to the sample preparation waste.

The waste generated with the **NucleoMag** **[®]** **Blood 200 µL** kit has not been tested for
residual infectious material. A contamination of the liquid waste with residual infectious
material is highly unlikely due to strong denaturing lysis buffer and Proteinase K
treatment but it cannot be excluded completely. Therefore, liquid waste must be
considered infectious and should be handled and discarded according local safety
regulations.

**4.1** **Disposal**

Dispose hazardous, infectious or biologically contaminated materials in a safe and
acceptable manner and in accordance with all local and regulatory requirements.

NucleoMag [®] Blood 200 μL

**Detailed protocol**

This protocol is designed for magnetic separators with static pins (e.g., NucleoMag [®] SEP)
and suitable plate shakers (see section 2.3). It is recommended using a Square-well
Block for separation (see section 1.2). Alternatively, isolation of DNA can be performed
in reaction tubes with suitable magnetic separators. This protocol is for manual use and
serves as a guideline for adapting the kit to robotic instruments.

**Before starting the preparation:**

   - Check if Proteinase K was prepared according to section 3.

**1** **Lyse samples**

Dispense **20 μL of Proteinase K** solution into each well of a Square-well Block.

Transfer **200 μL blood** (equilibrated to room temperature) to each well of a
Square-well Block. Do not moisten the rims of the well.

_Note: See recommendations for suitable plates or tubes and compatible magnetic_
_separators (section 2.3)._

Add **80 μL Buffer MBL1** to each sample and **mix** by repeated pipetting up and
down (3–5 times) **and** **shaking** for **5–10 min** at **room temperature** .

_Alternatively, when processing the kit without a shaker, pipette up and down 10 times_
_and incubate 5–10 min at room temperature._

**2** **Bind DNA to NucleoMag** **[®]** **B-Beads**

Add **25 μL NucleoMag** **[®]** **B-Beads** to each sample. Mix magnetic beads
thoroughly before dispensing to the samples.

Add **300 μL Buffer MBL2** to each sample and **mix** by pipetting up and down
3–5 times and **shake** for **5 min** to allow the DNA to bind to the magnetic beads.
Alternatively, when processing the kit without a shaker, pipette up and down 10
times and incubate 5 min at room temperature.

_Note: NucleoMag_ _[®]_ _B-Beads and Buffer MBL2 can be premixed. For each sample to_
_be processed, mix 25 μL of NucleoMag_ _[®]_ _B-Beads with 300 μL Buffer MBL2. Vortex_
_briefly. Depending on the dead volume of the reservoir, additional amounts of bead_
_suspension and binding buffer are necessary. Mix the solution several times to avoid_
_the beads to settle within the premix distribution step. Do not store the premix of the_
_NucleoMag_ _[®]_ _B-Beads and Buffer MBL2 longer than 12 h._

Be sure to resuspend the NucleoMag [®] B-Beads before removing them from the
storage bottle. Vortex storage bottle briefly until a homogenous suspension has
been formed.

NucleoMag [®] Blood 200 μL

Separate the magnetic beads against the side of the wells by placing the Squarewell Block on the magnetic separator. Wait at least **2 min** until all the beads have
been attracted by the magnet. Remove and discard the supernatant by pipetting.

_Note: Do not disturb the attracted beads while aspirating the supernatant. The_
_magnetic pellet is not visible in this step. Remove supernatant from the opposite side_
_of the well._

**3** **Wash with MBL3 (1** **[st]** **wash)**

Remove the Square-well Block from the magnetic separator.

Add **800 μL Buffer MBL3** to each well and resuspend the bead / DNA complex
by **shaking** at room temperature until the beads are resuspended completely
( **5 min** ). Alternatively, resuspend the beads by pipetting up and down (15 times).

_Note: Make sure that the magnetic beads are resuspended completely and form a_
_brownish suspension. If necessary increase shaking incubation time or number of_
_mixing cycles. Incomplete mixing may result in low purity of eluted DNA._

Separate the magnetic beads by placing the Square-well Block on the magnetic
separator. Wait for at least **2 min** until all the beads have been attrected to the
magnet. Remove and discard supernatant by pipetting.

_Note: Supernatant has a brownish color, magnetic bead pellet is now visible._

**4** **Wash with MBL3 (2** **[nd]** **wash)**

Remove the Square-well Block from the magnetic separator.

Add **800 μL Buffer MBL3** to each well for a second wash step with Buffer MBL3.
Wash the bead / DNA complex by **shaking** ( **5 min** ) at **room** **temperature** .
Alternatively, resuspend the beads by pipetting up and down (15 times).

Separate the magnetic beads by placing the Square-well Block on the magnetic
separator. Wait for at least **2 min** until all the beads have been attrected to the
magnet. Remove and discard supernatant by pipetting.

_Note: Supernatant is colorless, magnetic bead pellet is clearly visible._

**5** **Wash with 80 % ethanol**

Remove the Square-well Block from the magnetic separator.

Add **800 μL 80 % ethanol** to each well and wash the bead / DNA complex by
**shaking** (5 min) at **room** **temperature** . Alternatively, resuspend the beads by
pipetting up and down (15 times).

Separate the magnetic beads by placing the Square-well Block on the magnetic
separator. Wait for at least **2 min** until all the beads have been attrected to the
magnet. Remove and discard supernatant by pipetting.

_Note: Supernatant is colorless, magnetic bead pellet is visible now._


**6**
# !


**Wash with MBL4**

Leave Square-well Block on the magnetic separator.

Gently add **900 μL Buffer MBL4** to each well and **incubate** for **45–90 s** while
the beads are still attracted to the magnet.

Then aspirate and discard the supernatant.

_Note: Do_ _**not**_ _resuspend the beads in Buffer MBL4. This step is to remove traces of_
_ethanol and eliminates a drying step._

_Optional: Washing the magnetic beads with Buffer MBL4 may decrease the_
_DNA yield slightly. Alternatively, replace this washing step by air-drying of the_
_magnetic beads for 10–15 min until all of the ethanol from previous washing step_
_has evaporated. Beads with remaining ethanol appear to be glossy. Moderate_
_heating (37 °C) can support and shorten the air-drying step. Over drying the_
_beads may result in low yield in the final elution step._


**7** **Elute DNA**

Remove the Square-well Block from the magnetic separator.

Add desired volume of Buffer MBL5 (50–100 μL) to each well of the Squarewell Block and resuspend the bead/DNA complex by shaking (5–10 min).
Alternatively, resuspend the beads by pipetting up and down (15 times).

Separate the magnetic beads by placing the Square-well Block on the magnetic
separator. Wait for at least **2 min** until all the beads have been attrected to the
magnet. Transfer the supernatant containing the purified genomic DNA to the
Elution Plate.

_Note: Yield can be increased by 15–20 % by using pre-heated elution buffer (55–_
_72 °C) or by incubating the bead/elution buffer suspension at 55–72 °C for 10 min._

#### **6 Appendix**

**6.1** **Troubleshooting**

**Problem** **Possible cause and suggestions**

_Elution buffer volume insufficient_

             - Beads pellet must be covered completely with elution buffer

_Insufficient performance of elution buffer during elution step_

             - Remove residual buffers during the separation steps completely.
Remaining buffers decrease efficiency of subsequent wash
steps and elution step.

_Beads dried out_

             - Do not let the beads dry as this might result in lower elution
efficiencies.


Poor DNA

yield

Low purity


_Partial elution in Wash Buffer MBL4 already_

- Keep the separation plate on the magnet while dispensing
Wash Buffer MBL4. Do not resuspend beads in this buffer, and
do not incubate beads in this buffer for more than 2 min, as
Buffer MBL4 promotes DNA elution.

_Aspiration of attracted bead pellet_

- Do not disturb the attracted beads while aspirating the
supernatant, especially when the magnetic pellet is not visible
in the lysate.

_Incubation after dispensing beads to lysate_

- Mix immediately after dispensing NucleoMag [®] B-Beads and
Binding Buffer MBL2 to the lysate.

_Poor blood quality_

- Be sure that no blood clots are transferred to the well. Blood can
be stored at 2–8 °C for two weeks. Freeze samples if stored for
longer periods.

_Insufficient washing procedure_

- Use only the appropriate combinations of separator and plate,
for example, Square-well Block in combination with NucleoMag [®]
SEP.

_Carry-over of ethanol from ethanol wash step_

- Be sure to remove all of the ethanol from the ethanol wash
step. Carry-over of ethanol may interfere with downstream
applications. Use of Buffer MBL4 or introduce on air-drying step.

_Low purity_

- See above

_Time for magnetic separation too short_

- Increase separation time to allow the beads to be completely
attracted to the magnetic pins before aspirating any liquid from
the well.

_Aspiration speed too high (elution step)_

- High aspiration speed during the elution step may cause bead
carry over. Reduce aspiration speed for elution step.

- To remove magnetic beads from the eluates, put the elution
plate on the magnetic separator and aspirate the supernatant
after sufficient beads separation.

_Contamination of the rims_

- Do not moisten the rims of the Square-well Block when
transferring the blood. If the rim of the wells is contaminated,
seal the Square-well Block with Self-adhering PE Foil (see
ordering information) before starting the shaker.
