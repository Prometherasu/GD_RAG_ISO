Re : Engagement letter with respect to Illumina – Valogene contract 2025 - 2030

Dear Cyril Cabrol,

Hereafter, **GÈNES DIFFUSION** acknowledges and agrees to the terms and conditions of VALOGENE see
Appendix A). **GÈNES DIFFUSION** also confirms the commitment for the commonly purchased genotyping

microarrays by VALOGENE according to the following conditions:

1) Definitions

_Genotyping Microarray;_

_Microarray used to genotype DNA. One Microarray can be used to genotype multiple samples_
_(n=48, 96, or 192)._

_Attempted Bead Types (ABT)_

_Total number of probes (1 or 2 probes per loci/markers) to be designed on the microarray. The_
_number of ABT is higher than the number of markers._

_Customized Genotyping Microarray_

_Genotyping microarray elaborated within the provision from Valogene and the EuroGenomics_
_Partners of specific instructions and information._

_EuroGenomics Partners_

_Members of the EuroGenomics Cooperative as well as members of the EuroGenomics chip design_
_group (University of Liège in Belgium, CRV, INRAe, ELIANCE, University of Aarhus in Denmark, vit,_
_CONAFE, Balice) collaborating with Irish Cattle Breeding Federation (ICBF)._

_Third Party Customers_
_All customers who buy Customized Genotyping Microarray from Valogene and who are not_
_Members of EuroGenomics Cooperative or represented by Members of EuroGenomics cooperative._

_Commercial part of the Customized Genotyping Microarray :_

1

_Limited number of markers to be made available for all customers (EuroGenomics Partners and_

_Third Party Customers). This part was previously referred to as “public”, while it is confusing. The_
_list of selected markers and associated design remains confidential._

_Common part of the Customized Genotyping Microarray :_

_Limited list of markers to be read by all EuroGenomics Partners, in addition to the “Commercial_

_part”. These markers list shall not be exchanged outside of the EuroGenomics Partners._

_Private part of the Customized Genotyping Microarray_

_Parts that are specific to country, they are used for markers discovery and therefore customization_

_of the next versions of the customized genotyping microarray. These parts cannot be read by Third_
_Party Customer nor by other EuroGenomics users except agreement._

_Infinium EX :_

_Excalibur, “EX”, is the next innovation for the ILLUMINA array platform with several major_
_improvements compared to Infinium XT, while keeping the robustness and performance of Infinium_
_XT technology. It is targeted to make available 3 formats: 192, 96 & 48 samples per microarray. The_
_first one to be introduced will be the 192 format. It is expected to bring faster turnaround time,_
_allow for higher throughput, bringing further economy on scale for high-throughput laboratories._
_See Short Note on Infinium EX for Eurogenomics drafted October 18, 2024 by André Eggen_
_(ILLUMINA) – Appendix B._

2) Commitment (Genotyping Microarray: type and quantity):

The contract between ILLUMINA and VALOGENE covers the supply of the customized _EuroG MD_

_Genotyping Microarray to genotype 5,000,000 of samples._

_This Genotyping Microarray has been customized by and for EuroGenomics, and includes a_

_maximum of 115,000 ABT (~100 000 markers), and is composed by three (3) parts (commercial,_

_common and private)._

_From April 2025, a new version of the microarray will be introduced : EuroG MD v6. It will be_

_available under Infinium I-Select technology, 2 formats: XT (96 samples per chip) or HTS (24 samples_

_per chip)._

_Until the new version is ready to be used in the labs, labs will be delivered with the current EuroG_

_MD v5._

_From 2026 or later, the EuroG MD v7 Genotyping Microarray will be introduced using a new_
_technology called EX (the full content can be reviewed). The exact timeline of implementation of the_

_EX technology depends on the timeline of implementing this technology in all EuroGenomics labs._
_This timeline will be defined involving all parties (labs, the EuroGenomics chip development group,_

_Illumina, Valogene and EuroGenomics Members)._

_Up to 4 different versions of the microarray can be considered during the length of our contract : 2_
_new versions (EuroG MD v6 (XT technology) and EuroG MD v7 (EX technology)), 2 updates (with_

_add-on markers, if space is remaining). Planning of the new versions and updates is done in_

_collaboration with the EuroGenomics Chip Development group, but also depends on EX transition_

_and chip inventory._

3,000,000 of samples from the previous contract delivered; expected around April 2025). The term
of the new contract (2025 – 2030) is therefore planned from April 1 [st], 2025 to March 31 [st], 2030. If
all 5,000,000 of samples of the new contract will be delivered prior to March 31 [st], 2030, the new

contract will end by the date of the last delivery.
**GÈNES DIFFUSION** hereby confirms that the quantity under ‘2) Commitment’ needs to be
consumed during this term. The last shipment is targeted no later than 31/03/30.

At the end of the commitment duration, any remaining samples will be distributed according to

the number of samples to allocate at the end of the commitment as mentioned in table 2.

**GÈNES DIFFUSION** recognizes that VALOGENE does not guarantee delivery of EuroG MD

Genotyping Microarray for quantities above the committed quantity under (2), but VALOGENE will
do its utmost efforts to ensure orders above the committed quantity (including samples to allocate)

and will undertake actions in this perspective if needed.

**GÈNES DIFFUSION** supports the principle that VALOGENE and EuroGenomics Parties protect each

other from running out of Genotyping Microarrays within the term of the contract.

4) Authorized genotyping laboratories:

From the v6, the EuroG MD Genotyping Microarray (including commercial, common and private part as
