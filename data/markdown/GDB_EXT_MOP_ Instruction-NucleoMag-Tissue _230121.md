Genomic DNA from tissue
##### 2 Product description

2.1 The basic principle

The NucleoMag [®] Tissue procedure is based on reversible adsorption of nucleic acids to
paramagnetic beads under appropriate buffer conditions. Tissue samples, cells, or bacteria are
lysed with SDS / ​Proteinase K solution (Buffer T1). For the adjustment of the binding conditions
under which nucleic acids bind to the paramagnetic beads, Buffer MB2 and the NucleoMag [®]
B-Beads are added to the lysate. After magnetic separation, the paramagnetic beads are
washed twice to remove contaminants and salts using Wash Buffer MB3 and Wash Buffer
MB4. There is no need for a drying step as ethanol from previous wash steps is removed by
a final incubation of the beads in Buffer MB5. Finally, highly purified DNA is eluted with low
salt elution buffer (Buffer MB6) and can directly be used for downstream applications. The
NucleoMag [®] Tissue kit can be used either manually or automated on standard liquid handling
instruments or automated magnetic separators.

2.2 Kit specifications

NucleoMag [®] Tissue is designed for rapid manual and automated small-scale preparation of
highly pure genomic DNA from tissue samples, cells or bacteria using the NucleoMag [®] SEP
(see ordering information) or other magnetic separation systems (see section 2.3). Manual time
for the preparation of 96 samples is about 120 minutes. The purified DNA can be used directly
as template for PCR, blotting, or any kind of enzymatic reactions.

NucleoMag [®] Tissue allows easy automation on common liquid handling instruments. The
actual processing time depends on the configuration of the instrument and the magnetic
separation system used. Typically, 96 samples can be purified in less than 120 minutes using
the NucleoMag [®] SEP on the automation platform.

The kit provides reagents for the purification of up to 20 µg of pure genomic DNA from suitable
samples (up to 20 mg tissue, up to 1 × 10 [6] cells or up to 1 mL of an overnight culture of bacteria)
with an A 260 /A 280 ratio ≥ 1.6 – 1.9 and typical concentration of 20 – 50 ng / ​µL. Depending on
the elution volume used, concentrations of 10 – 150 ng / ​µL can be obtained.

Following lysis of samples with Proteinase K, NucleoMag [®] Tissue can be processed completely
at room temperature, however, elution at 55 °C will increase the yield by about 15 – 20 %.

For research use only.

2.3 Magnetic separation systems

For use of NucleoMag [®] Tissue, the use of the magnetic separator NucleoMag [®] SEP is
recommended. Separation is carried out in a Square-well Block (see ordering information). The
kit can also be used with other common separators.

Static magnetic pins

6 MACHEREY-NAGEL – 01/2023, Rev. 06

Genomic DNA from tissue

Separators with static magnetic pins, for example, NucleoMag [®] SEP (for manual use and for
use on liquid handling workstations): This type of separator is recommended in combination
with a suitable microplate shaker for optimal resuspension of the beads during the washing and
elution steps. Alternatively, beads can be resuspended in the buffer by pipetting up and down
several times. For fully-automated use on liquid handling workstations, a gripper tool is required,
the plate is transferred to the magnetic separator for separation of the beads and transferred to
the shaker module for resuspension of the beads.

Movable magnetic systems

Separators with moving magnetic pins: Magnetic pins / ​ rods are moved from one side of the
well to the other and vice versa. Beads follow this movement and are thus pulled through the
buffer during the wash and elution steps. Separation takes place when the system stops.

Automated separators

Separators with moving magnets: Magnetic beads are transferred into suitable plates or tubes.
Beads are resuspended from the rod-covered magnets. Following binding, washing or elution
beads are collected again with the rod-covered magnets and transferred to the next plate or
tube.

2.4 Adjusting the shaker settings

When using a plate shaker for the washing and elution steps, the speed settings have to be
adjusted carefully for each specific separation plate and shaker to prevent cross-contamination
from well to well. Proceed as follows:

Adjusting shaker speed for binding and wash steps:

- Load 1000 µL (for checking the settings for the binding step) or 600 µL (for checking the
settings for the washing steps) dyed water to the wells of the separation plate. Place the
plate on the shaker and start shaking with a moderate speed setting for 30 seconds. Turn
off the shaker and check the plate surface for small droplets of dyed water.

- Increase speed setting, shake for an additional 30 seconds, and check the plate surface
for droplets again.

- Continue increasing the speed setting until you observe droplets on top of the separation
plate. Reduce speed setting, check again, and use this setting for the washing step.

Adjusting shaker speed for the elution step:

- Load 100 µL dyed water to the wells of the collection plate and proceed as described
above.

2.5 Handling of beads

Distribution of beads

A homogeneous distribution of the magnetic beads to the individual wells of the separation plate
is essential for a high well-to-well consistency. Therefore, before distributing the beads, make
sure that the beads are completely resuspended. Shake the storage bottle well or place it on a
vortexer shortly. Premixing magnetic beads with the binding buffer allows easier homogenous
distribution of the beads to the individual wells of the separation plate. During automation,
a premix step before aspirating the beads / ​ binding buffer mixture from the reservoir is
recommended to keep the beads resuspended.

Magnetic separation time

Attraction of the magnetic beads to the magnetic pins depends on the magnetic strength of the
magnetic pins, the selected separation plate, distance of the separation plate from the magnetic
pins, and the volume to be processed. The individual times for complete attraction of the beads
to the magnetic pins should be checked and adjusted on each system. It is recommended
using the separation plates or tubes specified by the supplier of the magnetic separator.

Washing the beads

Washing the beads can be achieved by shaking or mixing. In contrast to mixing by pipetting up
and down, mixing by shaker or magnetic mixing allows simultaneous mixing of all samples. This
reduces the time and number of tips needed for the preparation. Resuspension by pipetting up
and down, however, is more efficient than mixing by a shaker or magnetic mix.

Resuspension Number of tips
Method Speed
efficiency needed

Magnetic mix + ++ Low

Shaker ++ ++ Low

Pipetting +++ +* High

+: acceptable, ++: good, +++: excellent, * 8-channel pipetting device

2.6 Elution procedures

Purified DNA can be eluted directly with the supplied Elution Buffer MB6. Elution can be carried
out in a volume of ≥ 50 µL. It is essential to cover the NucleoMag [®] Beads completely with
elution buffer during the elution step. The volume of dispensed elution buffer depends on the
magnetic separation system (e.g., the position of the pellet inside the separation plate). For
efficient elution, the magnetic bead pellet should be resuspended completely in the elution
buffer. For some separators, higher elution volumes might be necessary to cover the whole
pellet.

Elution is possible at room temperature. Yield can be increased by 15 – 20 % if elution is
performed at 55 °C.

##### 4 Safety instructions

When working with the NucleoMag [®] Tissue kit wear suitable protective clothing (e.g., lab
coat, disposable gloves, and protective goggles). For more information consult the appropriate
Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS available online _www.mn-net.com/msds_ ).

Caution: Sodium perchlorate in buffer MB2, MB3 and MB4 can form highly reactive compounds
when combined with bleach! Thus, do not add bleach or acidic solutions directly to the sample
preparation waste.

The waste generated with the NucleoMag [®] Tissue kit has not been tested for residual infectious
material. A contamination of the liquid waste with residual infectious material is highly unlikely
due to strong denaturing lysis buffer and Proteinase K treatment but it cannot be excluded
completely. Therefore, liquid waste must be considered infectious and should be handled and
discarded according local safety regulations.

4.1 Disposal

Dispose hazardous, infectious or biologically contaminated materials in a safe and acceptable
manner and in accordance with all local and regulatory requirements.

NucleoMag [®] Tissue

Detailed protocol

This protocol is designed for magnetic separators with static pins (e.g., NucleoMag [®] SEP)
and suitable plate shakers (see section 2.3). It is recommended using a Square-well Block for
separation (see section 1.2). Alternatively, isolation of DNA can be performed in reaction tubes
with suitable magnetic separators. This protocol is for manual use and serves as a guideline for
adapting the kit to robotic instruments.

Before starting the preparation:

- Check if Proteinase K was prepared according to section 3.

1 Lyse samples

Calculate the amount of lysis stock required: for each sample 25 µL of Proteinase K
solution +200 µL Buffer T1 are required. Prepare lysis stock solution accordingly and
vortex.

Never prepare the lysis stock solution more than 15 min before addition to the samples.
Proteinase K tends to self digestion when incubated in Buffer T1 without substrate.

Transfer 225 µL of the resulting stock solution to each lysis tube containing up to 20 mg
of tissue sample (e.g., mouse tail section), or up to 1 × 10⁶ cultured cells or up to 1 mL
of an overnight culture of bacteria. Close the individual tubes. Mix by vigorous shaking
for 10 – 15 s. Spin briefly (15 s; 1,500 x _g_ ) to collect any sample at the bottom of the
tube.

The sample must be submerged in the solution.

Incubate the tubes containing the samples at 56 °C until complete lysis is obtained (at
least 1 – 3 h or overnight). For cultured cells, incubation can be carried out at 70 °C for
10 – 15 min. For optimal lysis, mix occasionally during incubation. Make sure that the
lysis tubes are securely closed.

If RNA-free DNA is crucial for downstream applications, an RNase digest may be
performed: add 20 µL RNase A (20 mg / ​mL) solution (not included, see ordering
information) and incubate for additional 5 min at room temperature.

2 Clear lysates

Centrifuge the samples for 5 min at a full speed (5,600 – 6,000 x _g_ ). Remove cap strips.

Transfer 225 µL of the cleared lysate (equilibrated to room temperature) to a Squarewell Block. Do not moisten the rims of the well.

_Note:_ _See recommendations for suitable plates or tubes and compatible magnetic_
_separators section 1.2._

14 MACHEREY-NAGEL – 01/2023, Rev. 06

NucleoMag [®] Tissue

3 Bind DNA to NucleoMag [®] B-Beads

Add 24 µL of NucleoMag [®] B-Beads and 360 µL Buffer MB2 to each well of the
Square-well Block. Mix by pipetting up and down 6 times and shake for 5 min at room
temperature. Alternatively, when processing the kit without a shaker, pipette up and
down 10 times and incubate for 5 min at room temperature.

_Note: NucleoMag_ _[®]_ _B-Beads and Buffer MB2 can be premixed before use. Premix just_
_before use, storage of premixed beads and buffers is not recommended. Mix 24 µL_
_NucleoMag_ _[®]_ _B-Beads with 360 µL Buffer B2 per sample. Depending on the dead_
_volume of the reservoir, additional amounts of bead suspension and binding buffer_
_are necessary. Use 384 µL of the suspension per well. Be sure to resuspend the_
_NucleoMag_ _[®]_ _B-Beads before removing them from the storage bottle. Vortex storage_
_bottle briefly until a homogenous suspension has been formed._

Separate the magnetic beads against the side of the wells by placing the Squarewell Block on the NucleoMag [®] SEP magnetic separator. Wait at least 2 min until all
the beads have been attracted to the magnets. Remove and discard supernatant by
pipetting.

_Note: Do not disturb the attracted beads while aspirating the supernatant. The magnetic_
_pellet is not visible in this step. Remove supernatant from the opposite side of the well._

4 Wash with MB3

Remove the Square-well Block from the NucleoMag [®] SEP magnetic separator.

Add 600 µL Buffer MB3 to each well and resuspend the beads by shaking until the
beads are resuspended completely (5 min). Alternatively, resuspend beads completely
by repeated pipetting up and down (15 times).

Separate the magnetic beads by placing the Square-well Block on the NucleoMag [®]
SEP magnetic separator. Wait at least 2 min until all the beads have been attracted to
the magnet. Remove and discard supernatant by pipetting.

5 Wash with MB4

Remove the Square-well Block from the NucleoMag [®] SEP magnetic separator.

Add 600 µL Buffer MB4 to each well and resuspend the beads by shaking until the
beads are resuspended completely (5 min). Alternatively, resuspend beads completely
by repeated pipetting up and down (15 times).

Separate the magnetic beads by placing the Square-well Block on the NucleoMag [®]
SEP magnetic separator. Wait at least 2 min until all the beads have been attracted to
the magnet. Remove and discard supernatant by pipetting.

7 Elution

Remove the Square-well Block from the NucleoMag [®] SEP magnetic separator.

Add desired volume of Buffer MB6 (50 – 200 µL) to each well of the Square-well Block
and resuspend the beads by shaking 5 – 10 min at 56 °C. Alternatively, resuspend
beads completely by repeated pipetting up and down and incubate for 5 – 10 min at
56 °C.

Separate the magnetic beads by placing the Square-well Block on the NucleoMag [®] SEP
magnetic separator. Wait at least 2 min until all the beads have been attracted to the
magnets. Transfer the supernatant containing the purified genomic DNA to the Elution
Plate.

_Note: Yield can be increased by 15 – 20 % by using pre-warmed elution buffer (55 °C) or_
_by incubating the bead / ​elution buffer suspension at 55 °C for 10 min._

##### 6 Appendix

6.1 Troubleshooting

Problem Possible cause and suggestions

_Elution buffer volume insufficient_

           - Beads pellet must be covered completely with elution buffer

_Insufficient performance of elution buffer during elution step_

           - Remove residual buffers during the separation steps completely.
Remaining buffers decrease efficiency of following wash steps and
elution step.

_Beads dried out_

           - Do not let the beads dry as this might result in lower elution
efficiencies.


Poor DNA yield

Low purity

Suboptimal
performance
of DNA in

downstream

applications


_Partial elution in Wash Buffer MB5 already_

- Keep the beads on the magnet while dispensing Wash Buffer MB5.
Do not resuspend beads in this buffer, and do not incubate beads
in this buffer for more than 2 min, as this buffer is water-based and
might elute the DNA already.

_Aspiration of attracted bead pellet_

- Do not disturb the attracted beads while aspirating the supernatant,
especially when the magnetic pellet is not visible in the lysate.

_Incubation after dispensing beads to lysate_

- Mix immediately after dispensing NucleoMag [®] B-Beads / ​Buffer MB2
to the lysate.

_Insufficient washing procedure_

- Use only the appropriate combinations of separator and plate, for
example, Square-well Block in combination with NucleoMag [®] SEP.

- Make sure that beads are resuspended completely during the
washing procedure. If shaking is not sufficient to resuspend the
beads completely mix by repeated pipetting up and down.

_Carry-over of ethanol wash solutions_

- Be sure to remove all of the ethanolic wash solution, as residual
ethanol interferes with downstream applications.

_Low purity_

- See above

MACHEREY-NAGEL – 01/2023, Rev. 06 17

Genomic DNA from tissue

Problem Possible cause and suggestions

_Time for magnetic separation too short_


Carry-over of
beads

Cross
contamination



- Increase separation time to allow the beads to be completely
attracted to the magnetic pins before aspirating any liquid from the
well.

_Aspiration speed too high (elution step)_

- High aspiration speed during the elution step may cause bead carryover. Reduce aspiration speed for elution step.

_Contamination of the rims_

- Do not moisten the rims of the Square-well Block when transferring
the tissue lysate. If the rim of the wells is contaminated, seal
the Square-well Block with Self adhering PE Foil (see ordering
information) before starting the shaker.
