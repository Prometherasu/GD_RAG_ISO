and conditions. GÈNES DIFFUSION also confirms the commitment for the commonly purchased chips
by VALOGENE according to the following conditions:

1) Definitions

_Microarray used to genotype DNA_

_Attempted Bead Types (ABT)_

_Total number of probes (1 or 2 probes per loci/markers) to be designed on the microarray. The_
_number of ABT is higher than the number of markers._

_Customized Genotyping Microarray_

_Genotyping microarray elaborated within the provision from Valogene and the EuroGenomics_
_Partners of specific instructions and information._

_EuroGenomics Partners_

_Members of the EuroGenomics Cooperative as well as members of the EuroGenomics chip_
_design group (University of Liège in Belgium, CRV, INRAe, ELIANCE, University of Aarhus in_

_2022._

_Third Party Customers_

_All customers who buy Customized Genotyping Microarray from Valogene and who are not_
_Members of EuroGenomics Cooperative or Partners._

_Initial part of the Customized Genotyping Microarray_

_Limited list of SNP to be read by Third Party Customers. This part does exclude SNP protected_
_by IP. To avoid any confusion, this part is no longer called “public”: it contains “confidential”_
_information with restricted use._

_Common part of the Customized Genotyping Microarray_

_Limited list of SNP to be read by all EuroGenomics and ICBF users, in addition to the “initial_

_part”._

common and private) and is available under Infinium I-Select technology, 2 formats: XT (96 samples
per chip) or HTS (24 samples per chip). The EuroG MD v4 Genotyping Microarray might be updated
after one year (add-on, technology, format).

GÈNES DIFFUSION hereby confirms the commitment for 150,000 samples to be genotyped with the
EuroG MD v4 and next versions of the Genotyping Microarray.

11) Confidentiality:

EuroGenomics has developed the design for a customized genotyping microarray, as a result of the
efforts of a group of associated researchers (EuroGenomics Partners including ICBF in Irland) that
contribute to the enhancement of DNA-analysis of cattle and therefore the customization of Genotyping
Microarrays.

Therefore, the content and design of the EuroG MD v4 Microarray (and any update), including marker
combination and probe designs, do result from a specific and valuable know-how of the EuroGenomics
Partners and is intended to remain confidential. In accordance with the provisions of L151-1 of the of
the French Commercial Code, this information is protected by the trade secret.

To that end, GÈNES DIFFUSION agrees and confirms:

      To not reproduce or make copies of the content and designs of the EuroG MD Genotyping
Microarray, entirely or partially, as well as to not disclose the manifest file of the EuroG MD
to any other party, and more generally to not disclose content and designs (these obligations
of confidentiality do not apply to the extent the content or designs of the chips are in the
public domain or are required to be disclosed by law).

      To acknowledge appropriately in all publications, including (but not limited to) all research
papers, reports, and industry presentations the EuroG MD Genotyping Microarray as a
development by EuroGenomics and its collaborators.

GÈNES DIFFUSION also make sure that each authorized genotyping labs will respect these
confidentiality rules.

GÈNES DIFFUSION authorizes VALOGENE to share the number of samples genotyped with EuroG
MD v4 (and next versions) by the delivered labs for internal discussion within EuroGenomics and AWE
agrees to keep confidentiality on these figures and any confidential information distributed within the
EuroGenomics framework.
