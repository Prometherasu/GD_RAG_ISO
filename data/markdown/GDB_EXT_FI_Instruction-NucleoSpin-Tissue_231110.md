#### 2 Product description

2.1 The basic principle

With the NucleoSpin [®] Tissue method genomic DNA can be prepared from tissue, cells
(e.g., bacteria), and many other sources. Lysis is achieved by incubation of the sample
material in a proteinase K / SDS solution. Appropriate conditions for DNA binding to the
silica membrane in the NucleoSpin [®] Tissue Columns are achieved by the addition of
chaotropic salts and ethanol to the lysate. The binding process is reversible and specific
to nucleic acids. Contaminations are removed by subsequent washing with two different
buffers. Pure genomic DNA is finally eluted under low ionic strength conditions in a slightly
alkaline elution buffer.

2.2 Kit specifications

- NucleoSpin [®] Tissue is designed for the rapid, small-scale preparation of highly
pure genomic DNA from any tissue, cells, bacteria, yeast, forensic samples, serum,
plasma, or other body fluids. It is also suitable for preparation of DNA from human or
animal blood. The purified DNA can be used directly for PCR, Southern blotting, or
any kind of enzymatic reactions.

- The kit allows purification of up to 35 μg of pure genomic DNA with an A 260 / A 280 ratio
between 1.7 and 1.9. The NucleoSpin [®] Tissue Column is capable of binding up to
60 μg of genomic DNA.

- For lysis of certain bacterial and yeast strains, additional enzymes may be necessary
which are not part of this kit. See the relevant support protocol for details.

- Forensic quality product:
NucleoSpin [®] Tissue is certified as forensic quality product. Consumables
used in forensics need to be treated carefully to prevent DNA contamination.
MACHEREY‑NAGEL therefore has a stringently controlled production process
to avoid DNA contamination of consumables. Further, MACHEREY‑NAGEL uses
ethylene oxide (EO) treatment to remove amplifiable DNA, which might still be
introduced during the manufacturing process. MACHEREY‑NAGEL products
carrying the forensic quality seal, contain plastic materials that are EO treated. This
means, DNA of any kind, which might still be introduced into plastic consumables
during the production process, is inactivated by means of the treatment with
ethylene oxide, in order to prevent the generation of accidental human profile by
PCR amplification. Ethylene oxide treatment has been shown to be the method of
choice to prevent DNA profiles due to DNA contamination (Shaw et al. 2008; Figure
1).

2.3 Elution procedures

In addition to the standard method (recovery rate about 70 – 90 %), several modifications
are possible to increase yield, concentration, and convenience. Use elution buffer for one
of the following procedures:

- High yield: Perform two elution steps with the volume indicated in the individual
protocol. About 90 – 100 % of bound nucleic acid can be eluted.

- High concentration: Perform one elution step with 60 % of the volume indicated in
the individual protocol. Concentration of DNA will be approximately 30 % higher than
with standard elution. The yield of eluted nucleic acid will be about 80 %.

- High yield and high concentration: Apply half the volume of elution buffer as
indicated in the individual protocol, incubate for 3 min and centrifuge. Apply
a second aliquot of elution buffer, incubate and centrifuge again. Thus, about
85 – 100 % of bound nucleic acid is eluted in the standard elution volume at a high
concentration.

- Elution at 70 °C: For certain sample types, heating the elution buffer to 70 °C
increases the DNA yield.

Elution may also be performed with Tris-EDTA-buffer (TE) of pH equal or higher than 8.
This will increase DNA stability especially during long term and / or multi use storage at 4 °C

or ambient temperature by inhibition of omnipresent DNases. However, EDTA interferes,
depending on the final concentration, with certain downstream applications. Note: Elution
Buffer BE (5 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.5) provided with the kit does not contain EDTA.

For optimal performance of isolated DNA in downstream applications, we recommend
eluting with the supplied elution buffer and storage, especially long term, at -20 °C. Freezethaw cycles will have no effect on most downstream applications. Possible exceptions
are detection of trace amounts of DNA or long-range PCR (e.g., > 10 kbp). Multiple
freeze-thaw cycles or storing DNA at 4 °C or room temperature may influence detection
sensitivities or reaction efficiencies due to DNA shearing or adsorption to surfaces.

#### 3 Storage conditions and preparation of working solutions

_Attention: Buffers B3 and BW contain chaotropic salt! Wear gloves and goggles!_

_CAUTION: Buffers B3 and BW contain guanidine hydrochloride which can form highly_
_reactive compounds when combined with bleach (sodium hypochlorite). DO NOT add_
_bleach or acidic solutions directly to the sample-preparation waste._

- All kit components can be stored at 15 – 25 °C and are stable until: see package
label.

- During storage, especially at low temperatures, a white precipitate may form in
Buffer T1 or B3. Such precipitates can be easily dissolved by incubating the bottle at
50 – 70 °C before use.

Before starting any NucleoSpin [®] Tissue protocol, prepare the following:

- Wash Buffer B5: Add the indicated volume of ethanol (96 – 100 %) to Wash
Buffer B5 Concentrate. Mark the label of the bottle to indicate that ethanol was
added. Wash Buffer B5 can be stored at 15 – 25 °C for at least one year.

- Proteinase K: Add the indicated volume of Proteinase Buffer PB to dissolve
lyophilized Proteinase K. Proteinase K solution is stable at -20 °C for at least 6
months.

#### 4 Safety instructions

When working with the NucleoSpin [®] Tissue kit wear suitable protective clothing
(e.g., lab coat, disposable gloves, and protective goggles). For more information
consult the appropriate Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS available online at
_http://www.mn-net.com/msds_ ).

Caution: Guanidine hydrochloride in buffer B3 and buffer BW can form highly reactive
compounds when combined with bleach! Thus, do not add bleach or acidic solutions
directly to the sample preparation waste.

The waste generated with the NucleoSpin [®] Tissue kit has not been tested for residual
infectious material. A contamination of the liquid waste with residual infectious material
is highly unlikely due to strong denaturing lysis buffer and Proteinase K treatment but it
cannot be excluded completely. Therefore, liquid waste must be considered infectious
and should be handled and discarded according local safety regulations.

4.1 Disposal

Dispose hazardous, infectious or biologically contaminated materials in a safe and
acceptable manner and in accordance with all local and regulatory requirements.

#### 6 Support protocols

6.1 Support protocol for mouse or rat tails

Before starting the preparation:

- Check if Buffer B5 and Proteinase K were prepared according to section 3.

- Set an incubator or water bath to 56 °C.

1 Prepare sample

Cut two 0.6 cm-pieces of mouse tail and place them in a 1.5 mL centrifuge tube
(not provided).

If processing rat tails, one 0.6 cm-piece is sufficient.

2 Pre-lyse sample

Add 180 μL Buffer T1 and 25 μL Proteinase K and vortex. Incubate at 56 °C
overnight or until complete lysis is obtained. Lysis time can substantially be reduced
down to approximately one hour if the tissue is broken up mechanically (e.g., if the
tissue is cut into very small pieces before lysis).

Vortex occasionally during incubation or use a shaking water bath. To remove
residual bones or hair, centrifuge for 5 min at high speed (e.g., 11,000 x _g_ ). Transfer
200 μL supernatant to a new tube.

If processing several samples, Proteinase K and Buffer T1 may be premixed
directly before use. Do never mix Buffer T1 and Proteinase K more than 10 – 15 min
before addition to the sample: Proteinase K tends to self-digest in Buffer T1 without
substrate.

3 Lyse sample

Add 200 μL Buffer B3 to the lysate and vortex vigorously.

Buffer B3 and ethanol (see step 4) can be premixed before addition to the lysate.

Adjust DNA binding conditions

Add 210 μL ethanol to the lysate and vortex vigorously.

Proceed with step 5 of the standard protocol (see section 5).

6.2 Support protocol for bacteria

Before starting the preparation:

- Check if Buffer B5 and Proteinase K were prepared according to section 3.

- Set an incubator or water bath to 56 °C.

1 Prepare sample

Up to 1 mL of bacterial culture can be used for the preparation depending on, for
example, density of culture, culture medium, and bacterial strain.

Centrifuge up to 1 mL culture for 5 min at 8,000 x _g_ . Remove supernatant.

2 Pre-lyse sample

Resuspend the pellet in 180 μL Buffer T1 by pipetting up and down. Add 25 μL
Proteinase K. Vortex vigorously and incubate at 56 °C until complete lysis is
obtained (at least 1 – 3 h). Vortex occasionally during incubation or use a shaking
incubator.

_Samples can be incubated overnight as well._

_If RNA-free DNA is crucial for downstream applications, an RNase digest may be_
_performed: Add 20 μL RNase A (20 mg / mL) solution (not included; see ordering_
_information) and incubate for an additional 5 min at room temperature._

_Hard-to-lyse bacteria: Some strains, especially Gram-positive bacteria, are more_
_difficult to lyse. In such cases, a preincubation with a lytic enzyme is necessary:_
_Resuspend the pelleted cells in 20 mM Tris/HCl; 2 mM EDTA; 1 % Triton X-100;_
_pH 8 (instead of Buffer T1) supplemented with a final concentration of 20 mg/mL_
_lysozyme or 0.2 mg/mL lysostaphin and incubate for 30 – 60 min at 37 °C. Add_
_25 μL Proteinase K, incubate at 56 °C until complete lysis is obtained._

Proceed with step 3 of the standard protocol (see section 5).

supernatant and pellet the cells by centrifugation (5,000 x _g_, 10 min).

2 Pre-lyse sample

Resuspend the pellet in 600 μL sorbitol buffer (1.2 M sorbitol; 10 mM CaCl2;
0.1 M Tris/HCl pH 7.5; 35 mM ß-mercaptoethanol). Add 50 U lyticase or
zymolase*. Incubate at 30 °C for 30 min. This step degrades the yeast cell wall
creating spheroplasts. Spheroplast formation may be checked microscopically.
Centrifuge the mixture for 10 min at 2,000 x _g_ remove supernatant and resuspend
the pelleted spheroplasts in 180 μL Buffer T1. Add 25 μL Proteinase K solution
and vortex vigorously. Incubate at 56 °C until complete lysis is obtained (at least
1 – 3 h). Vortex occasionally during incubation or use a shaking water bath.

_Samples can be incubated overnight as well._

_If RNA-free DNA is crucial for downstream applications, an RNase digest may be_
_performed: Add 20 μL RNase A (20 mg / mL) solution (not included; see ordering_

6.8 Support protocol for genomic DNA from stool

Before starting the preparation:

- Check if Buffer B5 and Proteinase K were prepared according to section 3.

- Check if TE buffer is available.

- Set an incubator or water bath to 56 °C.

1 Prepare sample

Add 250 mg feces to 1 mL TE buffer (10 mM Tris / Cl; 1 mM EDTA, pH 8).
Resuspend the sample by vigorous vortexing (30 s).

Centrifuge the sample for 15 min at 4,000 x _g_ . Discard supernatant.

Resuspend the pellet in 0.2 – 1 mL Buffer T1. Use as much buffer as necessary for
good resuspension of the sample.

_The prepared pellet contains, among other constituents, cells from the digestive_
_tract and bacteria._

Transfer 200 μL of the resuspended sample to a new microcentrifuge tube.

Proceed with the addition of 25 μL Proteinase K in step 2 of the standard protocol
(see section 5).

_Human cells, bacterial cells, and cells of pathogens in the stool lyse during the_
_incubation step at 56 °C with Proteinase K with different efficiency. For the detection_
_of cells that are difficult to lyse (e.g., some bacteria and parasites) it can be beneficial_
_to perform an additional incubation at increased incubation temperature (up to_
_95 °C; 5 – 10 min). DNA yield will often be higher with such an additional incubation_
_step at high temperature. However, note that the ratio of human to non-human_
_DNA will typically change due to the increased release of bacterial / pathogen DNA._

7.1 Troubleshooting

Problem Possible cause and suggestions

_Incomplete lysis_

         - Sample not thoroughly homogenized and mixed with Buffer T1 /
Proteinase K. The mixture has to be vortexed vigorously
immediately after the addition of Buffer T1.

         - Decreased Proteinase K activity: Store dissolved Proteinase K at

          - 20 °C for 6 months.

_Reagents not applied properly_


No or poor
DNA yield

Poor DNA

quality



- Prepare Buffer B5 and Proteinase K solution according to
instructions (see section 3). Add ethanol to the lysates before
loading them onto the columns.

_Suboptimal elution of DNA from the column_

- For certain sample types, preheat Buffer BE to 70 °C before
elution. Apply Buffer BE directly onto the center of the silica
membrane.

- Elution efficiencies decrease dramatically, if elution is done with
buffers with a pH < 7.0. Use slightly alkaline elution buffers like
Buffer BE (pH 8.5).

- Especially when expecting high yields from large amounts of
material, we recommend elution with 200 μL Buffer BE and
incubation of the closed columns in an incubator at 70 °C for 5 min

before centrifugation.

_Incomplete lysis_

- Sample not thoroughly homogenized and mixed with Buffer T1 / ​
Proteinase K. The mixture has to be vortexed vigorously
immediately after the addition of Buffer T1.

- Decreased Proteinase K activity: Store dissolved Proteinase K at

  - 20 °C for 6 months.

- Prepare Buffer B5 and Proteinase K solution according to
instructions (see section 3). Add ethanol to the lysates before
loading them on the columns.

_RNA in sample_

- If RNA-free DNA is desired, add 20 μL of RNase A solution
(10 mg / mL; not supplied with the kit) before addition of Buffer B3
and incubate at 37 °C for 5 min.

_Too much sample material used_

- Do not use more sample material than recommended (25 mg for
most tissue types). If insoluble material like bones or hair remains in
the lysate, spin down the debris and transfer the clear supernatant
to a new microcentrifuge tube before proceeding with addition
of Buffer B3 and ethanol. The use of the NucleoSpin [®] Filter prior
column loading prevents column clogging.

_Incomplete lysis_

- Sample not thoroughly homogenized and mixed with Buffer
T1 /Proteinase K. The mixture has to be vortexed vigorously
immediately after the addition of Buffer T1.

- Decreased Proteinase K activity: Store dissolved Proteinase K at
-20 °C for 6 months.

_Reagents not applied properly_

- Prepare Buffer B5 and Proteinase K solution according to
instructions (see section 3). Add ethanol to the lysates before
loading them on the columns.

_Carry-over of ethanol or salt_

- Make sure to centrifuge ≥ 1 min at 11,000 x _g_ in order to remove
all of ethanolic Buffer B5 before eluting the DNA. If, for any reason,
the level of Buffer B5 has reached the column outlet after drying,
repeat the centrifugation.

- Do not chill Buffer B5 before use. Cold buffer will not remove salt
effectively. Equilibrate Buffer B5 to room temperature before use.
