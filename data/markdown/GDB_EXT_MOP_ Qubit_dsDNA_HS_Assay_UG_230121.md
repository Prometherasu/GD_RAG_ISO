Introduction



The Qubit [®] dsDNA HS (High Sensitivity) Assay Kits make DNA quantitation easy and
accurate. The kits include concentrated assay reagent, dilution buffer, and prediluted
DNA standards. Simply dilute the reagent using the buffer provided, add your sample
(any volume from 1–20 μL is acceptable), then read the concentration using the Qubit [®]
Fluorometer. The assay is highly selective for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) over
RNA (Figure 1, page 7) and is accurate for initial sample concentrations from
10 pg/µL to 100 ng/µL. The assay is performed at room temperature, and the signal
is stable for 3 hours. Common contaminants such as salts, free nucleotides, solvents,
detergents, or protein are well tolerated in the assay (Table 2, page 8). In addition to
the Qubit [®] dsDNA HS Assay Kits described here, we also offer other kits for assaying
RNA, protein, and dsDNA at a higher concentration range (Table 3, page 9).

**Note:** This Qubit [®] assay kit can be used with any Qubit [®] Fluorometer.

For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.

Before you begin

Materials required but

not provided          - Plastic container (disposable) for mixing the Qubit [®] working solution (step 1.3, page 3)

              - Qubit [®] assay tubes (500 tubes, Life Technologies, Cat. no. Q32856) or

Axygen [®] PCR-05-C tubes (VWR, part no. 10011-830)

Storage of Qubit [® ]

assay kits The Qubit [®] dsDNA HS Reagent and Buffer are designed for room temperature storage.
The Qubit [®] dsDNA HS Reagent is supplied in DMSO, which freezes at temperatures
lower than room temperature. Store the DNA standards at 4°C.

Critical assay parameters

Assay temperature
The Qubit [®] dsDNA HS Assay delivers optimal performance when all solutions are
at room temperature (22–28˚C). The Qubit [®] assays are designed to be performed
at room temperature, as temperature fluctuations can influence the accuracy of the
assay (Figure 2, page 7). To minimize temperature fluctuations, store the Qubit [®]
dsDNA HS Reagent and Buffer at room temperature and insert all assay tubes into the
Qubit [®] Fluorometer only for as much time as it takes for the instrument to measure the
fluorescence; the Qubit [®] Fluorometer can raise the temperature of the assay solution
significantly, even over a period of a few minutes. Do not hold the assay tubes in your
hand before reading because this warms the solution and results in a low reading.

Incubation time

To allow the Qubit [®] assay to reach optimal fluorescence, incubate the tubes for the DNA
and RNA assays for 2 minutes after mixing the sample or standard with the working
solution. After this incubation period, the fluorescence signal is stable for 3 hours at
room temperature.

Photostability of the Qubit [®] reagents
The Qubit [®] reagents exhibit high photostability in the Qubit [®] Fluorometer, showing
<0.3% drop in fluorescence after 9 readings and <2.5% drop in fluorescence after 40
readings. However, if the assay tube remains in the Qubit [®] Fluorometer for multiple
readings, a temporary reduction in fluorescence will be observed as the solution
increases in temperature (Figure 2, page 7). Note that the temperature inside the
Qubit [®] Fluorometer may be as much as 3°C above room temperature after 1 hour. For
this reason, if you want to perform multiple readings of a single tube, remove the tube
from the instrument and let it equilibrate to room temperature for 30 seconds before
taking another reading.

Qubit [®] Fluorometer calibration

For each assay, you have the choice to run a new calibration or use the values from the
previous calibration. When you first use the instrument, perform a new calibration each
time. As you become familiar with the assays, the instrument, your pipetting accuracy,
and significant temperature fluctuations within your laboratory, you can decide how
comfortable you are using the calibration data stored from the last time the instrument
was calibrated. Additionally, remember that the fluorescence signal in the tubes
containing standards and samples is stable for no longer than 3 hours. See Figure 3
(page 8) for an example of the calibration curve used to generate the quantification
results.

Handling and disposal No data are currently available that address the mutagenicity or toxicity of the Qubit [®]
dsDNA HS Reagent (Component A). This reagent is known to bind nucleic acid and is
provided as a solution in DMSO. Treat the Qubit [®] dsDNA HS Reagent with the same
safety precautions as all other potential mutagens and dispose of the dye in accordance
with local regulations.

Prepare samples and standards

This protocol assumes that you are preparing standards for calibrating the Qubit [®]
Fluorometer. If you plan to use the last calibration performed on the instrument (see
“Qubit [®] Fluorometer calibration” on page 2), you need fewer tubes (step 1.1) and
less working solution (step 1.3).

**1.1** Set up the required number of 0.5-mL tubes for standards and samples. The Qubit [®]

dsDNA HS Assay requires 2 standards.

**Note:** Use only thin-wall, clear, 0.5-mL PCR tubes. Acceptable tubes include Qubit [®]
assay tubes (Cat. no. Q32856) or Axygen [®] PCR-05-C tubes (part no. 10011-830).

**1.2** Label the tube lids.

**Note:** Do not label the side of the tube as this could interfere with the sample read. Label
the lid of each standard tube correctly. Calibration of the Qubit [®] Fluorometer requires
the standards to be inserted into the instrument in the right order.

**1.3** Prepare the Qubit [®] working solution by diluting the Qubit [®] dsDNA HS Reagent 1:200

in Qubit [®] dsDNA HS Buffer. Use a clean plastic tube each time you prepare Qubit [®]
working solution. **Do not mix the working solution in a glass container.**

**Note:** The final volume in each tube must be 200 µL. Each standard tube requires 190 µL
of Qubit [®] working solution, and each sample tube requires anywhere from 180–199 µL.
Prepare sufficient Qubit [®] working solution to accommodate all standards and samples.

For example, for 8 samples, prepare enough working solution for the samples and
2 standards: ~200 µL per tube in 10 tubes yields 2 mL of working solution (10 µL of
Qubit [®] reagent plus 1990 µL of Qubit [®] buffer).

**1.4** Add 190 µL of Qubit [®] working solution to each of the tubes used for standards.

**1.5** Add 10 µL of each Qubit [®] standard to the appropriate tube, then mix by vortexing

2–3 seconds. Be careful not to create bubbles.

**Note:** Careful pipetting is critical to ensure that exactly 10 µL of each Qubit [®] standard is
added to 190 µL of Qubit [®] working solution.

**1.6** Add Qubit [®] working solution to individual assay tubes so that the final volume in each

tube after adding sample is 200 µL.

**Note:** Your sample can be anywhere from 1–20 µL. Add a corresponding volume of
Qubit [®] working solution to each assay tube: anywhere from 180–199 µL.

**1.7** Add each sample to the assay tubes containing the correct volume of Qubit [®] working

solution, then mix by vortexing 2–3 seconds. The final volume in each tube should be
200 µL.

**1.8** Allow all tubes to incubate at room temperature for 2 minutes.

Proceed to “Reading standards and samples”; follow the procedure appropriate for
your instrument:

              - “Qubit [®] 3.0 Fluorometer” on page 4

              - “Qubit [®] 2.0 Fluorometer” on page 5

Qubit [®] 2.0 Fluorometer

**3.1** On the Home screen of the Qubit [®] 2.0 Fluorometer, press **DNA**, then select **dsDNA**

**High Sensitivity** as the assay type. The Standards screen is displayed.

**Note:** If you have already performed a calibration for the selected assay, the instrument
prompts you to choose between reading new standards and running samples using the
previous calibration. If you want to use the previous calibration, press **No** and skip to
step 3.5. Otherwise, continue with step 3.2.

**3.2** On the Standards screen, press **Yes** to read the standards.

**3.3** Insert the tube containing Standard #1 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press

**Read** . When the reading is complete (~3 seconds), remove Standard #1.

**3.4** Insert the tube containing Standard #2 into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press

**Read** . When the reading is complete, remove Standard #2.

When the calibration is complete, the instrument displays the Sample screen.

**3.5** Insert a sample tube into the sample chamber, close the lid, then press **Read** . When the

reading is complete (~3 seconds), remove the sample tube.

The instrument displays the results on the Sample screen. The value displayed
corresponds to the concentration after your sample was diluted into the assay tube. To
find the concentration of your original sample, you can record this value and perform
the calculation yourself (see “Calculating the sample concentration” below) or the
instrument can perform this calculation for you (see “Dilution Calculator” on page 6).

**3.6** Repeat step 3.5 until all samples have been read.

Calculate the sample
concentration – Qubit [®] 2.0

Fluorometer **Note:** The Qubit [®] 3.0 Fluorometer performs this calculation automatically.

The Qubit [®] 2.0 Fluorometer gives values for the Qubit [®] dsDNA HS Assay in ng/mL.
This value corresponds to the concentration after your sample was diluted into the
assay tube. To calculate the concentration of your sample, use the following equation:

200
Concentration of your sample = QF value ×

x

where QF value = the value given by the Qubit [®] 2.0 Fluorometer
x = the number of microliters of sample added to the assay tube

This equation generates a result with the same units as the value given by the
Qubit [®] 2.0 Fluorometer. For example, if the Qubit [®] 2.0 Fluorometer gave a
concentration in ng/mL, the result of the equation is in ng/mL.

assay tube. To have the Qubit [®] 2.0 Fluorometer perform this calculation for you, follow
the instructions below.

**4.1** After the sample measurement is complete, press **Calculate Stock Conc.** The Dilution

Calculator screen is displayed.

**4.2** Using the volume roller wheel, select the volume of your original sample that you

added to the assay tube. When you stop scrolling, the Qubit [®] 2.0 Fluorometer calculates
the original sample concentration based on the measured assay concentration.

**4.3** To change the units in which the original sample concentration is displayed:

**a.** Press **ng/mL** .

**b.** On the unit selection pop-up window, select a unit for your original sample

concentration.

**c.** Touch anywhere on the screen to close the pop-up window. The Qubit [®] 2.0

Fluorometer automatically converts the units to your selection.

**Note:** The unit button next to your sample concentration reflects the change in units.
For example, if you changed the unit to pg/μL, the button displays pg/μL.

**4.4** To save the data from your calculation to the Qubit [®] 2.0 Fluorometer, press **Save** on the

Dilution Calculator screen. The last calculated value of your measurement is saved in
the *.csv file and tagged with a time and date stamp.

**4.5** To exit the Dilution Calculator screen, press any navigator button on the bottom of the

screen or press **Read Next Sample** .

**Note:** When you navigate away from the Dilution Calculator screen, the Qubit [®] 2.0

Qubit [®] dsDNA HS Assay


Figure 1 DNA selectivity and sensitivity of the Qubit [®] dsDNA HS Assay (Q32851, Q32854). Triplicate 10-μL
samples of λ DNA (  ), _E. coli_ rRNA (  ), or a 1:1 mixture of DNA and RNA (  ) were assayed in the Qubit [®]
dsDNA HS Assay. Fluorescence was measured at 485/530 nm and plotted versus the mass of nucleic acid for
the DNA alone or RNA alone, or versus the mass of the DNA component in the 1:1 mixture. The variation (CV)
of replicate DNA determinations was ≤2%. The inset, a separate experiment with octuplicate determinations,
shows the extreme sensitivity of the assay for DNA. Background fluorescence has not been subtracted.

Figure 2. Plot of fluorescence vs. temperature for the Qubit [®] dsDNA HS Assay. The Qubit [®] assays are
designed to be performed at room temperature, as temperature fluctuations can influence the accuracy
